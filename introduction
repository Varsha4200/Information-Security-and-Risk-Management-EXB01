Initial Post: Introduction to the Cybersecurity Risk Management Proposal

Risk management for cybersecurity is an essential part of any contemporary business plan. Businesses need to implement comprehensive security frameworks that handle both physical and information security since cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated. The goal of this proposal is to create a thorough cybersecurity risk management plan for a fictitious business using the guidelines in Malcolm W. Harkins' Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable (2012). Sections on risk assessment, incident response, cybersecurity, physical security, and continuous improvement will all be covered in the plan.

Structure of the Proposal and Agreement with Risk Management

The security concept will be organised around essential components that guarantee a proactive and coordinated approach to both physical and information security in order to conform to Harkins' (2012) risk management guidelines. The following sections make up the framework:

Risk assessment is a fundamental phase that entails determining possible risks, weaknesses, and the possible effects they could have on the business. Taking into account both internal and external threats, like cyberattacks, data breaches, and natural disasters, we will perform a comprehensive risk assessment utilising both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Implementing focused security measures requires an understanding of the organization's unique risk environment, claims Harkins (2012).
Physical Security: To stop unwanted access to buildings and tangible assets, a robust physical security infrastructure is essential. This covers perimeter security measures, surveillance cameras, and access control systems. Physical security serves as the first line of defence against cyber attacks and reduces risks like data or device theft (Verizon, 2020).
Cybersecurity Measures: The technological safeguards against online threats are described in this section. Important actions consist of:

Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is a tried-and-true technique to limit unwanted access to private systems (Smith, 2020). MFA has been implemented by companies such as Google and Facebook in order to prevent breaches of their user accounts and data.
Firewalls and Network Monitoring: Constantly watching network traffic makes it easier to spot questionable activity. Additional levels of defence against ransomware and other intrusions are provided by the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) (Jones, 2021).
Encrypting sensitive data while it's in transit and at rest guarantees that it can't be read even if it gets intercepted.

A cyberattack or data breach can be prevented by following the measures outlined in an incident response plan. It include locating the breach, minimising the harm, alerting relevant parties, and repairing the compromised systems. The overall impact of security problems is lessened by a well-crafted incident response plan (Harkins, 2012).
Continuous Improvement: The business needs to upgrade its security measures on a regular basis as cyber threats change. This entails training staff, doing recurring vulnerability assessments, and keeping up with new threats. This innovative strategy guarantees the business's resilience to potential threats. Harkins (2012).
Important Security Procedures

Our suggested cybersecurity methods will tackle a number of threats, such as service outages, illegal access, and data breaches.

As previously stated, multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is a crucial safeguard against unwanted access. MFA is a component of the account security strategy used by companies such as Google and Facebook. Google stated in 2019 that MFA prevented more than 100 million account takeovers (Smith, 2020).

Network Segmentation: Segmentation limits the lateral movement of attackers within the network and reduces the scope of potential breaches by breaking the network up into smaller, isolated portions. In order to isolate key systems and lessen the impact of future attacks, Target, for instance, adopted network segmentation following the 2013 hack (Jones, 2021).

Endpoint protection, which includes antivirus software and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, is crucial to thwarting malware and ransomware attacks as more devices connect to business networks.

Difficulties in Combining Information and Physical Security

Ensuring smooth communication between the two domains is one of the primary problems in integrating information and physical security. For instance, to guarantee that only authorised individuals have access to sensitive data, physical access control systems and IT systems must cooperate (Harkins, 2012). In actuality, this entails coordinating security team and IT department rules and making sure that operational effectiveness is not hampered by physical security measures.

In order to overcome these obstacles, we will put in place a single security management system that combines cybersecurity and physical security measures. This would include tools that enable real-time network activity and physical access point monitoring, guaranteeing a thorough picture of any security occurrences. We will prioritise security investments that meet business goals by taking a risk-based approach, which will guarantee that security and user convenience are properly balanced (Harkins, 2012).

Using the Harkins Principles

Harkins (2012) highlights the necessity of "protect to enable"—security solutions ought to assist corporate goals in addition to reducing risks. We accomplish this in our approach by implementing security measures that minimise interference with corporate activities while safeguarding vital assets. Multi-factor authentication, for instance, safeguards user accounts and private information without materially compromising user comfort. Furthermore, network segmentation supports long-term business continuity by guaranteeing that the organization's digital operations are resistant to threats.

In conclusion

This idea for cybersecurity risk management employs a thorough, risk-based strategy to safeguard the organization's digital and physical assets. We make sure that the security measures not only handle possible hazards but also allow the business to expand and adapt in a secure environment by adhering to the guidelines in Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable (Harkins, 2012).

First per review: This proposal provides a solid foundation for a cybersecurity risk management strategy, addressing both physical and digital threats in a balanced and effective manner. The integration of real-world examples and Harkins’ Protect to Enable philosophy adds depth and practical relevance to the recommendations. By expanding on certain sections, such as risk assessment, incident response, scalability, and employee engagement, the proposal can be further strengthened to offer a more comprehensive and actionable plan for managing cybersecurity risks as the company grows.

Second review: The proposal effectively introduces a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management strategy by aligning with Malcolm W. Harkins’ Protect to Enable philosophy. It takes a balanced approach by integrating physical and information security measures and follows a structured process that includes risk assessment, physical security, cybersecurity measures, incident response, and ongoing enhancement. This foundational framework offers a strategic roadmap for safeguarding organizational assets against a wide range of threats while ensuring business continuity.
