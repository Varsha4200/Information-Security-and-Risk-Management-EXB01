AI has the potential to completely transform cybersecurity by enhancing threat prediction and prevention, detection, and reaction times. But its application needs to be done carefully, especially when it comes to moral dilemmas and an excessive dependence on automation. Organisations can improve their cybersecurity posture and handle the difficulties presented by emerging technologies by using AI with well-known frameworks such as NIST and MITRE ATT&CK. AI will continue to play a key role in the ongoing effort to protect infrastructure and sensitive data as the threat landscape changes.
